          <h3>IN THE 1940s, a group of Russian researchers sealed five prison inmates in an airtight chamber.</h3>

          <h3>The prisoners were dosed with an experimental gas that would prevent them from sleeping. 
          Their conversations were electronically monitored, and their behaviour was observed 
          through secret two-way mirrors.For the first few days, everything seemed fine. 
          But after the fifth day, they slowly began to exhibit signs of stress. They 
          became paranoid and stopped talking to one another, whispering about each other 
          into the microphones.Nine days in, the screaming began. Two of the sleepless prisoners 
          just started running around the chamber, yelling so hard their vocal chords nearly broke.
          Suddenly, however, the voices stopped, and the chamber became dead quiet. Fearing the worst, 
          the researchers announced that they were opening the chamber. But a voice from inside answered: 
          “We no longer want to be freed.”</h3>

         <h3>On the fifteenth day, the stimulant gas was replaced by fresh air. The results were chaotic.
          
          One inmate was dead. The inmates had been severely mutilated, flesh torn off their bodies 
          and stuffed into the floor drain. They seemed to have ripped open their own abdomens, and 
          even eaten their own flesh</h3>

          <h3>They refused to leave by force, fighting back with a powerful aggression none of 
          the researchers could have imagined they possessed. They fought furiously against 
          being removed and anesthetised; one even tore his own muscles and ripped his bones 
          apart during the struggle. When asked why they had mutilated themselves, each gave
          The exact same answer: “I must remain awake.”
           
          The researchers wanted to kill the prisoners and remove all traces of the experiment, 
          but their commanding officer demanded it be resumed immediately, with the researchers 
          joining the inmates in the sealed chamber. Horrified, the chief researcher shot him 
          point blank.
          He then shot and killed the two last surviving subjects, and set about covering up 
          all that had taken place.</h3>
